<h2>About us</h2>
<p>I joined the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences at the end of 2020 after coming back from Harvard.
Currently, there are five members in our team. Our research focuses on nuclear medicine imaging physics, specifically in image reconstruction,
artifact correction, image quality improvement and quantitative calculation for PET/CT, PET/MR imaging. We have successfully applied several
developed techniques to clinics and been referred by companies such as GE, Philips, Siemens, and United Imaging Healthcare. <br /></p>
<p>Ever since the establishment of the lab, we have published 16 papers as first or corresponding authors in 《European Journal of Nuclear 
Medicine and Molecular Imaging》, 《IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging》, 《Cerebral Cortex》, 《Cancer Imaging》, 《EJNMMI Physics》, 《Physics in Medicine and Biology》
, and 《Medical Physics》, etc. The laboratory have been accepted for 20 abstracts in annual meeting of the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI),
5 abstracts in European annual meeting of nuclear medicine (EANM), and 4 abstracts in the IEEE and SPIE meeting series, 
in which 10 are oral presentations. Previous lab member have been admitted to reknown Universities for their PhD or master programms. </p>
